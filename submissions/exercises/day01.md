    Also this ads should not be here because it may looks redundant![image](https://github.com/Randylrnz/AWSCC-CodeQuest-UI-UX/assets/151449579/48264e60-1bef-4c42-80b7-1396d5e8f5dc)
    maybe it should be included in this part![image](https://github.com/Randylrnz/AWSCC-CodeQuest-UI-UX/assets/151449579/0eccd74f-e71a-4127-9743-f3d922847fd6)
    For Lazada - ![image](https://github.com/Randylrnz/AWSCC-CodeQuest-UI-UX/assets/151449579/c7650ff9-7320-4fae-9ee5-bc1fc459de98) it is better if the text are alligned/measured equally.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee and Lazada were both online shopping platform wherein both incorporate unique design or what they called "branding." For my experience, it is easier to scan and understand Lazada website because there are nit that much unnecessary elements, you can find the item you're looking quickly.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
