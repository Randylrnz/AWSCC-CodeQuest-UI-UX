For Day 2, I got to know Figma, where I learned basic tutorials and things I need to know in Figma. Figma is a good design tool for beginners, just like me. Today, I learned about frames, shapes, colors, text, images, exporting, components, commenting, and sharing, which will help me in the following days of this Code Quest. I learned a lot, and I believe this learning will not end after Code Quest; instead, I will treasure it in the future.
